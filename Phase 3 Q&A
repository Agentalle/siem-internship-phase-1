### 1. **Detecting Fileless Malware with Sysmon/Winlogbeat**

**Fileless malware** lives in memory and avoids writing files to disk.

**Detection with Sysmon/Winlogbeat:**

* **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Process Creation): Unusual parent-child processes like `explorer.exe â†’ powershell.exe`.
* **Sysmon Event ID 7** (Image Load): Tracks DLLs loaded into processes; look for unsigned or abnormal DLLs.
* **Event ID 3** (Network Connection): Malicious PowerShell scripts often open remote connections.
* **Winlogbeat** helps forward these logs to ELK/other SIEMs for correlation and alerting.

**Detection Tip:** Look for:

* `powershell.exe` or `wscript.exe` with base64-encoded commands.
* Suspicious memory-resident payloads or anomalous behavior in memory.

### 2. **Explain and Detect DNS Tunneling**

**DNS tunneling** uses DNS queries to exfiltrate data or establish C2 channels.

**Detection Techniques:**

* Unusually long DNS query strings (often base64 or hex).
* High volume of DNS traffic from a single host.
* NXDOMAIN or TXT record anomalies.
* Same domain repeatedly queried with changing subdomains.

**Tooling:**

* **Sysmon ID 22** (DNS Query - Windows 10+).
* **Suricata + Zeek** for protocol-level DNS inspection.

### 3. **Indicators of Lateral Movement**

Lateral movement means moving from one system to another within a network.

**Indicators:**

* Use of **WMI**, **PsExec**, **SMB**, **RDP**, or **Remote PowerShell**.
* **Sysmon Event ID 3**: Outbound SMB or RPC traffic to internal IPs.
* **Logon Events 4624/4672**: Look for logons from unusual IPs or at odd hours.
* Multiple authentication failures followed by success.
* Execution of tools like `net.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, `quser`.

### 4. **Common Persistence Methods in Windows**

Persistence ensures malware survives reboots or logouts.

**Examples:**

* **Registry Run Keys** (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`)
* **Scheduled Tasks / AT Jobs**
* **WMI Event Subscriptions**
* **Startup folder scripts**
* **DLL Hijacking**
* **Services Creation** (look for `sc.exe` usage)

**Detect using:**

* **Sysmon Event ID 1, 13, 19, 20, 21**
* Windows Event ID **7045**: A service was installed.

---

### 5. **Detecting Mimikatz and Credential Dumping**

**Indicators:**

* Access to `lsass.exe` using `SeDebugPrivilege`.
* Use of tools like `procdump.exe`, `taskmgr`, `mimikatz.exe`.
* **Sysmon ID 10**: Process accessed another process (look for access to `lsass.exe`).
* **Event ID 4688**: Tracks command-line execution.

**EDR Detection:**

* Look for loading of `sekurlsa.dll`, `dpapi.dll` by suspicious processes.

---

### 6. **Key Sysmon Event IDs for PowerShell**

* **Event ID 1**: Detect PowerShell execution, especially with encoded commands.
* **Event ID 3**: PowerShell initiating network connections.
* **Event ID 7**: Suspicious DLLs loaded into PowerShell.
* **Event ID 11**: File creation by PowerShell scripts.

Also enable **PowerShell Module Logging** and **Script Block Logging** in Windows Defender or GPO.

---

### 7. **PowerShell Payloads and Evasion Tactics (EDR)**

**Payload Examples:**

* `Invoke-Mimikatz`, `Empire`, `PowerView`, `PowerSploit`.

**Evasion Techniques:**

* Obfuscation with tools like `Invoke-Obfuscation`.
* Base64-encoded payloads.
* `Reflection.Assembly.Load()` to execute in-memory.
* Use of alternate execution policy (`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`).

**Defensive Tip:** Enable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) and script block logging.

---

### 8. **Brute-force RDP Detection Strategies**

**Detection:**

* **Event ID 4625**: Failed logon (look for Type 10 = RDP).
* Multiple failures followed by **4624** (successful login).
* Lockouts (Event ID **4740**) after repeated attempts.
* Login attempts from external IPs.

**SIEM Rules:**

* X failed logins in Y minutes from same IP.
* Alert on login attempts outside business hours.

---

### 9. **Honeypots for Lateral Movement**

Deploy honeypots as bait to catch internal attackers.

**Types:**

* **Canary Tokens**: Fake credentials or documents.
* **Honey Users/Hosts**: Accounts/machines with no real purpose.
* Fake SMB shares, fake RDP endpoints.

**Tools:**

* **OpenCanary**, **Honeyd**, **Kippo**, **Cowrie**.
* Monitor for any interaction with these resources as they indicate potential compromise.

### 10. Correlating SIEM Logs in APT Scenarios

APT = Advanced Persistent Threat.** You need multi-log correlation.

key Logs to Correlate:

Authentication logs: Repeated 4625s, followed by 4624 from the same IP.
Process creation: Sysmon ID 1 showing PowerShell or cmd used for recon.
Network traffic: Sysmon ID 3 or proxy logs showing beaconing to C2.
Persistence creation: New services (7045), scheduled tasks (4698).
DNS logs: Look for tunneling or rare domains.

Correlate using:

MITRE ATT\&CK framework tags.
Timeline-based visualizations in ELK/Graylog/Splunk.
Threat intelligence enrichment to identify known IOCs.
