# Detection Use Case: Suspicious File Download & Execution (T1105)

## Scenario Description
I simulated a suspicious file download and execution on my Linux VM (IP: 192.168.123.128). After gaining access as `admin1`, I downloaded a malicious script (`malicious.sh`) from my host (IP: 192.168.123.1) using `wget` and executed it, creating a file `/tmp/compromised.txt` as proof.

## Objective
The goal was to detect the download and execution of a malicious file, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk (on host Windows machine)
- **Log Source:** Linux VM (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Monitoring Tool:** `auditd` on the Linux VM

## Event ID / Data Source Mapping
- **Log File:** `/var/log/audit/audit.log` (sourcetype `linux_audit`)
- **Event Description:** `wget` commands downloading files and `bash` executing scripts

## Detection Logic / Query
I used this Splunk query to detect the activity:This query flags file downloads from my host and the execution of the script.

## Logs or Sample Event
From `/var/log/audit/audit.log`:
## Analyst Notes
- This alert might flag legitimate file downloads. I’d refine it by adding filters for known good IPs or file names.
- The script execution created a file in `/tmp/`, which could be a sign of persistence—further investigation is needed.

## Detection Status
Successfully implemented.
