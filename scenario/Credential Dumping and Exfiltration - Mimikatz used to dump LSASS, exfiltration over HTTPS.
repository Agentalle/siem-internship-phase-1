# Detection Use Case: Credential Dumping and Exfiltration (T1003, T1041)

## Scenario Description
I simulated credential dumping and exfiltration on my Windows VM (IP: 192.168.123.129). After gaining access, I used Mimikatz to dump credentials from LSASS, saving them to `C:\Temp\creds.txt`. The credentials were then exfiltrated over HTTPS to my host (IP: 192.168.123.1:8443).

## Objective
The goal was to detect credential dumping and data exfiltration, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk (on host Windows machine)
- **Log Source:** Windows VM (Windows 10)
- **Monitoring Tool:** Sysmon on the Windows VM

## Event ID / Data Source Mapping
- **Log Source:** Sysmon (Event ID 1: Process Creation, Event ID 3: Network Connection)
- **Log Source:** Windows Security (Event ID 4688: Process Creation)
- **Event Description:** `mimikatz.exe` execution and HTTPS connection to the attacker's server

## Detection Logic / Query
I used this Splunk query to detect the activity:This query flags Mimikatz execution and the HTTPS exfiltration.

## Analyst Notes
- Mimikatz detection might flag legitimate admin tools—context like LSASS access or exfiltration is key.
- The HTTPS exfiltration could be encrypted—monitoring for unusual outbound traffic volumes can help.

## Detection Status
Successfully implemented.
