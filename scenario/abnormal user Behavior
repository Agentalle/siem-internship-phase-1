# Detection Use Case: Abnormal User Behavior (T1078)

## Scenario Description
I simulated abnormal user behavior on my Linux VM (IP: 192.168.123.128). Using the compromised account `admin1`, I logged in at 2:30 AM (outside normal hours of 9 AM–5 PM) and accessed `/etc/passwd`, mimicking an attacker using valid credentials for malicious purposes.

## Objective
The goal was to detect abnormal user behavior, such as after-hours logins and access to sensitive files, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK T1078 (Valid Accounts).

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk (on host Windows machine)
- **Log Source:** Linux VM (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Monitoring Tool:** `auditd` on the Linux VM

## Event ID / Data Source Mapping
- **Log File:** `/var/log/auth.log` (sourcetype `linux_secure`)
- **Log File:** `/var/log/audit/audit.log` (sourcetype `linux_audit`)
- **Event Description:** SSH logins outside business hours and access to `/etc/passwd`

## Detection Logic / Query
I used this Splunk query to detect the behavior:This query flags after-hours logins and suspicious file access by `admin1`.

## Logs or Sample Event
From `/var/log/auth.log`:
## Analyst Notes
- This alert might flag legitimate after-hours logins by admins. I’d refine it by baselining `admin1`’s normal behavior more thoroughly.
- Accessing `/etc/passwd` isn’t always malicious, but combined with the login time, it’s suspicious.

## Detection Status
Successfully implemented.
