# Detection Use Case: DDoS Attack (HTTP Flood)

## Scenario Description
I simulated a DDoS attack by launching an HTTP flood against a web server (Apache) running on my Linux VM (IP: 192.168.123.128). The attack was performed from my host Windows machine (IP: 192.168.123.1) using hping3 to flood the target with TCP SYN packets on port 80.

## Objective
The goal was to detect a DDoS attack by identifying a sudden spike in HTTP requests and create an alert in Splunk to notify me of such activity in the future.

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk (installed on host Windows machine)
- **Log Source:** Linux VM (Apache web server)
- **Attack Tool:** hping3 (on host Windows machine via WSL)

## Event ID / Data Source Mapping
- **Log File:** `/var/log/apache2/access.log` on the Linux VM
- **Sourcetype:** `apache_access` in Splunk
- **Event Description:** HTTP requests logged as access attempts, showing client IPs and request timestamps

## Detection Logic / Query
I used the following Splunk query to detect a spike in HTTP requests:
