# Detection Use Case: Hidden User Account Creation

## Scenario Description
I simulated hidden user creation on my Linux VM (IP: 192.168.123.128) by creating a new user named `hiddenuser` with the command `sudo useradd -m hiddenuser -p $(openssl passwd -1 Password123!)`. I also added the user to the `sudo` group to mimic privilege escalation.

## Objective
The goal was to detect unauthorized user creation by monitoring system commands with `auditd`, and create a Splunk alert to flag this activity, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK T1136 (Create Account).

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk (installed on host Windows machine)
- **Log Source:** Linux VM (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Monitoring Tool:** `auditd` on the Linux VM

## Event ID / Data Source Mapping
- **Log File:** `/var/log/audit/audit.log` on the Linux VM
- **Sourcetype:** `linux_audit` in Splunk
- **Event Description:** Audit events showing user creation (e.g., `useradd` command creating `hiddenuser`)

## Detection Logic / Query
I used this Splunk query to detect user creation:This query looks for `useradd` commands creating the `hiddenuser` account and triggers an alert if detected.

## Sample Alert Screenshot

## Logs or Sample Event
Here’s a sample log from `/var/log/audit/audit.log` during the user creation:This shows the `useradd` command creating the `hiddenuser` account.

## Analyst Notes
- This detection might catch legitimate user creation by admins. I’d add filters for specific users or timeframes to reduce false positives.
- The alert worked well, catching the exact command and user created.

## Detection Status
Successfully implemented.
